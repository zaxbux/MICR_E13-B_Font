# MICR E13-B Font

I needed a MICR font for a project I was working on and found that such a font didn't readily exist, so I set out to design my own.

Using the specification published by Payments Canada, I created SVGs for each "Stroke" and converted them into a font with Inkscape and FontForge. The standard is based on ISO 1004:1995.

> This font has not been professionally tested, so I don't recommend using it for real cheques.
